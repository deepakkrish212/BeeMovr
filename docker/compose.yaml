# HOW WE RUN BEEMOVR.COM
# @remarks
# For development purposes, just running `cd ./BeeMovr && pnpm dev` is
# perfect, and in fact that is how we run a development server all the
# time. However, if you want to run a production server, by which we
# mean deployment to a server so that it becomes available to everyone
# on the internet, we use Docker Compose to deploy Next.js through
# Node.js and reverse proxy that through Nginx.
#
# First, go to certbot website and issue a certificate:
#   https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal
#
# Then, copy the generated files to BeeMovr/docker folder on the server:
#   scp -r /etc/letsencrypt <username>@<ip address>:<BeeMovr dir>/docker/letsencrypt
#
# HOW TO RUN NODE.JS and REVERSE PROXY
# @example
# cd BeeMovr/docker
# cp .env.production .env.local
# docker compose build
# docker compose up -d
#
# HOW TO STOP BEEMOVR.COM
# @example
# docker compose down
