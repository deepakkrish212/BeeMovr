## Dev log

**2023-09-24 Soobin** <br>
The MVP was good and all, but we decided to throw away the first version of BeeMovr and recreate. [1]
Leigh Halliday's YouTube video on Next.js and Mapbox was incredibly helpful. [2]
Immediate todos I have to do right now are: finish recreating BeeMovr with Next.js; read Nginx documentation to set up the nginx.conf; and containerize with Docker and deploy with Docker Compose.

```bash
# Initialize Next.js
yarn create next-app

# Start a development server.
yarn dev

# Create optimized production build
yarn build
```
